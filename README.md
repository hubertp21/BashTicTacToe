# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is a simple command-line based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Bash. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols ('x' or 'o') on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You can also load a saved game or save your progress at any point.

## Features

- **Two-player mode:** Play against a friend or family member.
- **Load and save game:** Save your progress to a file and load it later to continue playing.
